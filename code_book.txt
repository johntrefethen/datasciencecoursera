Code book for "summary mean and standard deviation" data set =================

General Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an
age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer
and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to
label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training
data and 30% the test data. See "Raw Data Set Information" section below for details 
on these files.

Below is the code book for the summary data file.

Summary Data Information
==================
The summary set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value 
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample.
These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean tBodyAccMean tBodyAccJerkMean tBodyGyroMean tBodyGyroJerkMean

The following variables have been summarized by mean and grouped by Test Performed 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and

Raw data information ==================

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and
50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is
assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter
with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in
time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean
norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag,
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain
signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each
pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
