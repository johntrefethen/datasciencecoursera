### Code book for the "Summary Mean and Standard Deviation" data set 

##### Source data for this data set is from the UC-Irvine [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphone). Below is a short description from UCI web site describing the experiment from which the data was gathered.
---

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an
age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer
and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to
label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training
data and 30% the test data. See "Raw Data Set Information" section below for details 
on these files.

Below is the code book for the summary data file.

##### Summary Data Set Information
This tidy data set contains summary set of mean and standard deviation values. The mean and standard deviation for each 
varaible was grouped by Test Performed (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and
Subject ID (labeled 1-30 based on the volunteer):

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample.
These are used on the angle() variables:

* gravityMean 
* tBodyAccMean 
* tBodyAccJerkMean 
* tBodyGyroMean 
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

Column details are provided in the table below.

=========================

See below for detailed information regarding the raw data, taken from the UCI web site above.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and
50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is
assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter
with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in
time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean
norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag,
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain
signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each
pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
